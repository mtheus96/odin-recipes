# Odin Recipes
This is an exercise of Odin Project HTML course. In this project I will make a web page using only HTML based in the subjects that I have studied through the course until now and also I will pratice my git skills, so every time I build something I will commit and push to my repository and update this readme file.

## What I've learned
Doing this project made me understand some concepts like absolute and relative paths.

I've learned how to make the right use of **ordered** and **unordered** lists and how to use them with links.

I've also learned how to use ***alt*** attribute, **picture** and **figcaption** elements to present images in a more sofisticated way wich is useful to support screen reader's used by user's that need acessibility support.
